# Pull Request Bounty for Politehnica Students in Summer 2015

ProxySQL is an open-source, high-performance proxy for MySQL and compatible forks.
Its main values are:
* high performance
* high availability (since it's a proxy, whenever it's down, access to the database is down as well)
* flexibility (allow the user to customize the behaviour of the proxy as much possible)

How will you use these values? Make sure you take them into consideration with
each coding decision that you make.

# How is this going to work?

The value of the prize is $150, and it will be awarded for the best pull
request submitted from your own fork. The pull requests should be sumitted until
Friday, July 31st 2015, midnight in Bucharest time. In order to choose something
to work on, ask questions on the repo issues or ping us via e-mail asking for
guidance.

The pull requests will be evaluated, subjectively, by @renecannao and @aismail,
by the following criteria:
* choice of problem (which of the issues did you choose, how important it is)
* technical solution (how well written is it, how well documented, how efficient)

Any undergraduate student from Politehnica University of Bucharest, Faculty of
Automatic Control and Computers is allowed to participate.

We will publish the result on Monday, July 13th 2015 and will contact the
winner to send the prize :)

# Notes

The idea of this bounty came from @aismail's presentation at Politehnica's
[Open Source Summer School](https://open-source.cs.pub.ro/summer-school/2014/wiki/home)
from June 30th 2015 named "How to go to Vama Veche with Open Source".
