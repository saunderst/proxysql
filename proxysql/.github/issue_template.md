This is the place for paid support and community users to report a **reproducible bug** in ProxySQL, suggest enhancements or make feature requests. This also includes documentation errors and/or missing documentation. 

* Remember, this is the place for fixing and improving ProxySQL rather than the place to get free support. 
* If you do not have a paid support contract please try https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/proxysql. Due to the high volume of requests, we are unable to always provide timely support for community users.

If you are submitting a reproducible bug report, please provide:
[ ] A clear description of your issue
[ ] The version of OS and ProxySQL
[ ] Every step to reproduce the issue
[ ] The error log 
[ ] If it is a crashing bug, a core dump will be extremely useful.

Please use markdown to format code or SQL: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

Thank you!
